<h1>About me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I am a UI/UX designer and web developer with a strong background in management and IT. With a Google Professional Certificate in UI/UX Design and a Coursera certification, I have developed expertise in user-centered design, wireframing, prototyping, and front-end development.</p>
<p>I have expanded my technical skills by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to bridge the gap between design and development. My goal is to create responsive, visually engaging, and user-friendly websites that ensure both functionality and aesthetics.</p>
<p>With experience in building intuitive digital experiences, I am looking for an entry-level role in UI/UX design or web development, where I can apply my skills and continue growing professionally.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for someone with a keen eye for design, a user-centered approach, and front-end development expertise, let’s connect!</p>
